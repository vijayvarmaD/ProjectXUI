# EatUp

This project consumes a Node API [ProjectXServer](https://github.com/vijayvarmaD/ProjectXServer/blob/master/README.md) which serves as angular front end for all the 4 users (customer, vendor, delivery person, admin). All users can login and have access to various controls according to the user role.

Libraries:
1. Angular Material: Material design components have been used extensively in this project. Material Design is a really cool UI/UX principle(being used in Android >= 5) that delivers a clean interface and has greater focus on the data being presented. I have used 'cdk data-table' provided by material creates a fluid UX. Although, the intial setup takes a little longer when compared with jquery plugins.

2. Bootstrap: The best html, css library yet.
